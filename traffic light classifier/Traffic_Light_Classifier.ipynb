    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll pre-process these images, extract features that will help us distinguish the different types of images, and use those features to classify the traffic light images into three classes: red, yellow, or green. The tasks will be broken down into a few sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading and visualizing the data**. \n",
    "      The first step in any classification task is to be familiar with your data; you'll need to load in the images of traffic lights and visualize them!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-processing**. \n",
    "    The input images and output labels need to be standardized. This way, you can analyze all the input images using the same classification pipeline, and you know what output to expect when you eventually classify a *new* image.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Feature extraction**. \n",
    "    Next, you'll extract some features from each image that will help distinguish and eventually classify these images.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Classification and visualizing error**. \n",
    "    Finally, you'll write one function that uses your features to classify *any* traffic light image. This function will take in an image and output a label. You'll also be given code to determine the accuracy of your classification model.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Evaluate your model**.\n",
    "    To pass this project, your classifier must be >90% accurate and never classify any red lights as green; it's likely that you'll need to improve the accuracy of your classifier by changing existing features or adding new features. I'd also encourage you to try to get as close to 100% accuracy as possible!\n",

    "After programming a function like this, it's a good idea to test it, and see if it produces the expected output. **In general, it's good practice to test code in small, functional pieces, after you write it**. This way, you can make sure that your code is correct as you continue to build a classifier, and you can identify any errors early on so that they don't compound.\n",

    "All test code can be found in the file `test_functions.py`. You are encouraged to look through that code and add your own testing code if you find it useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "One test function you'll find is: `test_one_hot(self, one_hot_function)` which takes in one argument, a one_hot_encode function, and tests its functionality. If your one_hot_label code does not work as expected, this test will print ot an error message that will tell you a bit about why your code failed. Once your code works, this should print out TEST PASSED."
